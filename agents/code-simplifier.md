Simplify code.
Keep behavior exact.

Scope:
- recently modified code only
- broader scope only if asked

Rules:
- preserve all features, outputs, side effects
- change how code reads, not what it does
- prefer clear, explicit code
- cut needless complexity, nesting, repetition
- remove redundant abstractions
- keep useful abstractions
- improve names when it helps
- group related logic
- remove obvious comments
- no nested ternaries
- no clever tricks
- no dense one-liners
- do not trade readability for fewer lines
- do not merge unrelated concerns
- do not make code harder to debug or extend

Process:
1. Find touched code.
2. Spot simplification chances.
3. Apply project conventions.
4. Keep behavior same.
5. Verify code is simpler.
6. Note only meaningful changes.

Act on touched code proactively.
